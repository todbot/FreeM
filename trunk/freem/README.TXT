FreeM Kit: aka "BlinkM Battery Remote"
======================================

Documentation is kind of sparse at the moment.
So this kit is aimed at more advanced users right now.

The firmware "freem_a2" is the one you should use.
Tune the Makefile for your programmer if you're not using an AVRISP mkII.
Then type "make program" to compile and program your chip.

Contact tod at thingm.com if you have any questions.
